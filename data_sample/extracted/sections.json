    "text": "In planning and conducting an attack, those who plan or decide upon an attack must\ntake feasible precautions to verify that the targets to be attacked are military objectives174 and not\nprotected by the law of war from being made the object of attack.175\nThese measures help implement the principle of distinction in classifying persons or\nobjects as military objectives.176 Like other precautions in planning and conducting attacks,177\nthese measures are also part of the implementation of the principle of proportionality.178 These\nmeasures help reduce uncertainty in armed conflict,179 and they reinforce military effectiveness\nbecause they help avoid attacks that would serve no military purpose.180\nAs discussed in § 5.2.3.2 (What Precautions Are Feasible), what precautions are feasible\ndepends greatly on the context, including what time and other circumstances permit.181 The\nspecific verification measures may depend on how the attack is being conducted182 and what type\nof target is being attacked.183 For example, when troops are in contact with enemy forces during\ncombat operations, they may need to react immediately based on their professional judgment\ndeveloped through training and experience and in accordance with military doctrine. On the\nother hand, with more time and resources available in planning an attack during the deliberate\ntargeting process, planners and analysts may need to gather more information and conduct a\nmore extensive review of whether a potential target is a military objective.184 In any event, the\nlaw of war, including the requirements discussed in this section, does not forestall commanders\nand other decision-makers from making decisions and taking actions at the speed of relevance,\nincluding in high-intensity conflict, based on their good faith assessment of the information that\nis available to them at the time, as explained in § 5.4.3.2 (Classifying Persons or Objects as\nMilitary Objectives When Planning and Conducting Attacks).185\nFeasible precautions to verify that objectives to be attacked are military objectives may\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\n• Reviewing the accuracy and reliability of the information supporting the assessment that\na potential target is a military objective;\n• Checking potential target locations against no-strike and sensitive site lists;186\n• Reviewing previously approved targets at reasonable intervals as well as when warranted\nin light of fresh information and changing circumstances, e.g., to ascertain whether\nenemy forces continue to use the object for military purposes or whether the object’s\ndestruction or neutralization continues to offer a definite military advantage;187\n• Gathering more information, such as visual identification of the target through\nintelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms;188\n• Taking steps when carrying out a planned attack to confirm that the person or object to be\nattacked, is, in fact, the intended target of the attack; and\n• Issuing communications to elicit reactions that inform whether a person or object is a\nmilitary objective, such as summons of vessels to stop;189 directions given from\nintercepting aircraft;190 warnings required before the cessation of protection of medical\nunits, vessels, or facilities;191 or some types of warnings before attacks that may affect the\ncivilian population.192",
