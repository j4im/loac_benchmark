    "question": "During an armed conflict, a U.S. military intelligence cell identifies a suspected enemy command post located in a building within a city. The location is flagged for a potential airstrike. As part of the targeting process, analysts discover that the building is listed on a 'no-strike' list due to its historical status as a protected cultural site, but recent drone footage shows armed personnel entering and exiting, and intercepted communications suggest military activity. The intelligence cell is under time pressure to act on the target before the suspected enemy command post relocates. What does Section 5.5.3 of the DoD Law of War Manual permit or require regarding the attack on this target?",
    "correct_answer": "The planners must check the target location against the no-strike and sensitive site lists as a feasible precaution, and if the building is on the no-strike list, they must further verify whether its protection status has changed due to current military use before proceeding with the attack (Section 5.5.3).",

    "question": "During a high-intensity naval conflict, a U.S. warship detects an unidentified vessel approaching a restricted military zone at high speed. Intelligence reports indicate enemy forces sometimes use disguised civilian vessels for military operations in this region, but the vessel's markings and radio silence make its status unclear. The warship is authorized to engage military objectives but must avoid targeting civilian vessels. With limited time to act, the commander considers issuing a summons to the vessel to stop and identify itself, but there is a risk that the vessel could be hostile and use the warning to launch a preemptive attack or escape. According to Section 5.5.3 of the DoD Law of War Manual, what is the correct legal approach regarding the use of communications to verify the vessel's status before attacking?",
    "correct_answer": "The commander may issue a communication, such as a summons to stop, to elicit a reaction that helps determine if the vessel is a military objective, as this is a feasible precaution permitted by Section 5.5.3.",
    "incorrect_answers": [
      "The commander is prohibited from issuing any warnings or communications that could alert a potential enemy vessel, and must attack immediately if there is any suspicion.",
      "The commander must wait for absolute certainty that the vessel is a military objective before taking any action, even if it risks losing the opportunity to neutralize a threat.",
      "The commander is required to physically board the vessel to verify its status before any attack, regardless of the operational risks or time constraints."
