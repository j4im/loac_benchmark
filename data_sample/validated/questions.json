    "question": "During an armed conflict, State A establishes a hospital and safety zone in a town near the front lines, clearly marked and notified to all parties, housing wounded soldiers (hors de combat), medical staff, and some civilians. Intelligence reports suggest that a small group of enemy combatants has infiltrated the zone and is using a section of an abandoned building within it as a base for planning attacks. State A's military commander is considering an airstrike on the building. According to Section 5.5.2 of the DoD Law of War Manual, what is the correct legal course of action?",
    "correct_answer": "The commander must not make the hospital and safety zone, or persons and objects within it, the object of attack unless the protection has been specifically forfeited under the circumstances (e.g., if the enemy group’s actions amount to using the zone to commit acts harmful to the enemy and, after due warning, they fail to cease those acts). An attack is prohibited unless these conditions are met. (Section 5.5.2)",
