The commander orders an airstrike on the building, reasoning that eliminating the enemy leader is a high-value military objective.

At the same time, sporadic hostile fire is still coming from a nearby building, and the unit commander is concerned about potential threats in the area. One of the wounded enemy soldiers is observed attempting to crawl away from the scene, while another appears to be calling out for medical assistance. The commander considers whether lethal force may be used against the wounded soldiers to eliminate any possible threat. What does the Law of War Manual require in this situation?",

Lethal force may not be used against wounded, unarmed, and defenseless combatants who are not engaging in hostile acts or attempting to escape. The soldier calling for medical help remains protected, but the one attempting to crawl away must be assessed: if the movement is solely to seek safety or medical assistance, he remains hors de combat and protected; only if he attempts to escape or resumes hostilities does protection cease.",

    "question": "During an armed conflict, State A's military unit observes an individual from State B approaching their forward operating base under a white flag, accompanied by another person carrying a camera. The individual claims to be a parlementaire seeking to deliver a message from State B's commander. However, intelligence suggests the cameraman may be a journalist, not a military aide. The base commander is concerned that the cameraman may record sensitive information or use the opportunity for espionage. What does the Law of War Manual require regarding the reception of the parlementaire and the cameraman?",
    "correct_answer": "The Law of War Manual (section 5.5.2) prohibits the improper refusal to receive a parlementaire; however, the commander is not required to admit the cameraman if there is a valid reason, such as security concerns or suspicion of espionage. The commander must receive the parlementaire but may impose conditions, including excluding or searching accompanying persons.",
    "incorrect_answers": [
      "The commander must admit both the parlementaire and the cameraman without restriction, as any refusal would violate the prohibition against refusing to receive a parlementaire.",
      "The commander may refuse to receive the parlementaire entirely if there are any security concerns about those accompanying them.",
      "The commander must treat both the parlementaire and the cameraman as protected persons and allow them free access throughout the base."

    "question": "During an armed conflict, State A and State B agree to establish a neutralized zone in a densely populated urban area to protect civilians and wounded soldiers from hostilities. The agreement specifies that no military operations or presence are allowed within the zone, and all parties must respect its neutrality. However, State B receives credible intelligence that State A is covertly using a hospital within the neutralized zone to store weapons and coordinate attacks. State B considers launching a targeted strike against the hospital, arguing that the misuse of the neutralized zone by State A nullifies its protected status. What does the Law of War Manual require/permit/prohibit?",
    "correct_answer": "The Law of War Manual (section 5.5.2) prohibits attacks against persons and objects within neutralized zones, even if there are allegations of misuse, unless the protected status has been formally revoked following proper procedures. Unilateral action by State B without such revocation remains prohibited.",
    "incorrect_answers": [
      "State B is permitted to attack the hospital immediately because the misuse by State A automatically nullifies the neutralized zone's protection.",
      "State B may conduct limited reconnaissance and warning shots within the neutralized zone as a proportional response to suspected violations.",
      "State B must detain all individuals leaving the neutralized zone on suspicion of involvement in the misuse, regardless of their status as civilians or wounded soldiers."
