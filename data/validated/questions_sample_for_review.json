The unit prepares to strike the location, but before launching, receives time-sensitive information that enemy forces are using an adjacent school as a temporary ammunition storage site. The school is listed on the no-strike and sensitive site lists due to its protected status. The intelligence suggests that the command post and the school are separated by only a narrow alleyway.

In this scenario, the targeting team must check both the suspected command post and the adjacent school against these lists and take appropriate precautions to avoid striking protected sites, even under time pressure. Striking the command post without accounting for the proximity to the no-strike-listed school would violate this requirement.",
