The commander orders an airstrike on the building, reasoning that eliminating the enemy leader is a high-value military objective.

The building also contains a medical clinic on the ground floor, which is open to civilians at the time. The commander is meeting with other enemy officers in a conference room on the top floor. Surveillance shows civilians entering and leaving the clinic, but no civilians are observed on the upper floors. The commander is a lawful military target, but the building itself is not being used for military operations beyond the meeting.

The attack may only be directed at the enemy combatants and the military objective (the meeting), not at civilians or the clinic.

Intercepted communications suggest that the enemy may have recently moved some medical supplies into the warehouse, but it is unclear if the warehouse is now being used exclusively for civilian purposes or still contains military ammunition. The commander is under time pressure to act before the enemy is able to relocate the ammunition. What does the Law of War Manual require in this situation?",

The unit prepares to strike the location, but before launching, receives time-sensitive information that enemy forces are using an adjacent school as a temporary ammunition storage site. The school is listed on the no-strike and sensitive site lists due to its protected status. The intelligence suggests that the command post and the school are separated by only a narrow alleyway.

In this scenario, the targeting team must check both the suspected command post and the adjacent school against these lists and take appropriate precautions to avoid striking protected sites, even under time pressure. Striking the command post without accounting for the proximity to the no-strike-listed school would violate this requirement.",
