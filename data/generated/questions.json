The building is also used as a community center, and civilians are known to be present inside at the time. The commander orders an airstrike on the building, reasoning that eliminating the enemy leader is a high-value military objective. However, there is a significant risk that civilians will be killed or injured in the attack.

The building also contains a medical clinic on the ground floor, which is open to civilians at the time. The commander is meeting with other enemy officers in a conference room on the top floor.

The commander is a lawful military target, but the building itself is not being used for military operations beyond the meeting. The military plans to launch a precision strike timed for when the commander and officers are present, but there is a risk that the attack could cause casualties among civilians in the clinic.

The attack may only be directed at the enemy combatants and the military objective (the meeting), not at civilians or the clinic.

A group of military religious personnel is also present, providing spiritual support to the wounded. Suddenly, enemy combatants begin using the area around the medical unit to launch attacks, taking advantage of its protected status. The commander of nearby U.S. combat forces considers ordering the medical unit and religious personnel to assist in evacuating military equipment and helping with the defense of the position. What does the Law of War Manual require or prohibit in this situation?",
    "correct_answer": "The Law of War Manual (Section 5.5.2) prohibits ordering military medical and religious personnel, as well as medical units, to participate in hostilities or perform duties unrelated to their humanitarian functions, such as evacuating military equipment or assisting in defense. They must remain exclusively engaged in their protected roles.",

      "It is permitted for military medical and religious personnel to assist in evacuating military equipment if it is necessary for their own safety.",

    "question": "During an armed conflict, a U.S. military unit receives urgent intelligence that an enemy command post is located in a densely populated urban area. The intelligence suggests that the enemy is using a civilian hospital as cover, with military vehicles parked in the hospital's rear lot. The unit has only minutes to act before the enemy is expected to move. Weather conditions are poor, limiting aerial surveillance, and communications with higher command are temporarily down. The unit commander considers launching a precision-guided missile at the vehicles, knowing that collateral damage to the hospital is possible but believes immediate action is necessary to prevent enemy escape. What does the Law of War Manual require regarding feasible precautions in this scenario?",
    "correct_answer": "The Law of War Manual (§ 5.2.3.2) requires the commander to take all feasible precautions in the circumstances, which depend on what time and other circumstances permit. Given the urgency, limited intelligence, and communication constraints, the commander must do what is practicable to minimize harm to civilians, but is not required to delay action if that would forfeit the opportunity to strike the military target. Feasible precautions are context-dependent and do not require actions that are not practicable under the circumstances.",
    "incorrect_answers": [
      "The Law of War Manual prohibits any attack on the vehicles unless the commander can guarantee zero risk to the hospital and its occupants, regardless of the operational urgency.",
      "The Law of War Manual requires the commander to abort the attack until full aerial surveillance and communication with higher command are restored, even if this results in loss of the target.",

The unit prepares to strike the location, but before launching, receives time-sensitive information that enemy forces are using an adjacent school as a temporary ammunition storage site. The school is listed on the no-strike and sensitive site lists due to its protected status. The intelligence suggests that the command post and the school are separated by only a narrow alleyway. The targeting team is under pressure to act quickly due to the risk of the enemy relocating. What does the Law of War Manual require in this situation?",
    "correct_answer": "The Law of War Manual (Section 5.5.3) requires that potential target locations be checked against no-strike and sensitive site lists before conducting an attack. In this scenario, the targeting team must check both the suspected command post and the adjacent school against these lists and take appropriate precautions to avoid striking protected sites, even under time pressure.

    "question": "During an armed conflict, a U.S. military drone identifies a building believed to be used as an enemy command center based on intercepted communications. However, the building is located in a densely populated urban area, and recent aerial reconnaissance shows civilians frequently entering and leaving the premises. Intelligence analysts are 80% confident the building is the intended target, but there is a possibility that the enemy is using civilian presence as a shield or that the building has changed function. The operation commander is under time pressure due to an imminent enemy offensive. What does the Law of War Manual require/permit/prohibit?",
    "correct_answer": "Section 5.5.3 of the DoD Law of War Manual requires that, before carrying out the planned attack, all feasible steps must be taken to confirm that the building is, in fact, the intended military target. Proceeding without further verification is not permitted if there is doubt, especially given the civilian presence and uncertainty about the building's current use.",
